<h1>Phase 0 Week 1</h1>
  <h4>August 23, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The focus of week 1 has been Command Line and Version control. Each exercise requires a written reflection of the material covered. These reflections have been the most challenging and time consuming part for me but I can see there will be a huge payoff from going through the writing process. I know it seems obvious but you really do need to understand something well in order to write about it.

      Here are some of my version control takeaways:
      <ul>
        <li>Version control is a way of tracking and organizing changes to files.</li>
        <li>Each commit is a different save point for one to many files.</li>
        <li>If something is no longer working, version control allows you to roll back to a point when things were working.</li>
        <li>Because it keeps track of exactly what changes are being made to each file, version control allows multiple developers to work on the same projects without rewriting or erasing each otherâ€™s work.</li>
        <li>If the same developers work on the same files, Git will be able to recognize there is a conflict and help you properly merge those changes without losing work.</li>
      </ul>
