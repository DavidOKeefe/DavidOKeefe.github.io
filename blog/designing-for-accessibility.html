        <p>
          The ways in which websites are being designed for accessibility is an issue facing the tech industry today. At a high level, accessibility refers to making websites available to people with hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are at a point where technology is catching up with the accessibility needs but the features and tools which are available are being inconsistently used. Standards have been developed but often those standards are applied to sites after the fact, making the functionality less than user friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A potential solution that has been suggested by the community is to build sites from the ground up with accessibility in mind. It has been suggested that this not only helps improve accessibility issues but also makes for a better UI/UX experience for all site users.
