### 3.5 Solo Challenge Reflection


Q: What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
A: I learned how these can be used to create space between content and other elements on the page.

Q: What did you learn about CSS positioning?
A: Positioning is definitely a challenge. I learned how absolute and fixed will take elements out of the normal flow and how static and relative can be used to impact elements within the flow.

Q: What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
A: I don't think anything was particularly easy. I really had to use a trial and error approach with each piece of styling in order to get it (somewhat) working. I think in the future I would start by adding boarders to all my elements before I start moving things around. I started doing this late and it exposed some bizarre formatting.

Q: What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
A: I learned to keep at it. Having the wireframe gave me something to shoot towards and with enough experimentation you can get things to work.
