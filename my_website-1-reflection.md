## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

At a high level, repositories are places to store the files for your program. If you want to start tracking your project, you can create a new repository through Github and then clone the repository to your local machine so you can track all file changes. Detailed steps are described in reflection 1.4

Open source is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone. As a beginner I like the idea of open source since my focus is on learning and sharing. I feel that it creates great opportunities for collaboration and exchanging ideas as well as being a contribution to the world. I can imagine having mixed feelings about it as my code quality improves and if my work was used by businesses for profit. Adding licenses to your open source projects can add varying protections but at the very least require those who use your code to give you credit for your work.

During this challenge I was able to further practice my git branching and committing flows. The **github.io** suffix in the repository name which allowed my index to be viewable online was very cool.

The other resources I referred to were:
